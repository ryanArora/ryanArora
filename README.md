## Hey, I'm Ryan! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a high school student who does programming as a hobby. Right now I'm working on CalmBot, an open source Discord bot for my Hypixel guild. I'm also interested in website development with React and ops with AWS, Travis CI and Docker. Feel free to message me on Discord if you want to contribute or have any questions. I'm a huge fan of open source so feel free to use any of the code I write for your own projects.
